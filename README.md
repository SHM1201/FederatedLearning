# Object Detection with FederatedLearning

The basic idea behind this project was prompted by the recent developments in the deployment of satellite constellations, computing on satellites, and the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices. Large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite deployments can collect massive amounts of Earth imagery and sensory data for the scenarios mentioned above. However, it is not truly feasible for the satellites to downlink all the high-resolution images to the ground stations, then let the models there train or infer on this data, and repeat this cycle for several iterations, for a real-time object detection case. Apart from the bandwidth issues, isolated connectivity, and privacy concerns while transmitting the data between the satellites and the ground station too are a concern. The idea is that there could be a way such that we can train a model on every satellite that will have its own dataset and this model then can be used later to detect objects in real-time. We can leverage Federated Learning(FL), wherein the satellites collaboratively train ML models locally and infer on the new data locally, without sharing the captured images with the ground station and then send these model parameters to the ground station for aggregation with all other local model parameters. Aggregation of the models at the server/ground station ensures that the global model is an improvised version that could be sent back to the satellites/clients for further local training.
